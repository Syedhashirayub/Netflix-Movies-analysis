Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into one of the largest entertainment and media companies.

The large number of movies and series available on the platform. In this project, I have done data manipulation in python to analyse the dataset 
and to get answers to some basic questions about the movies and TV shows on this platform like Are we certain that movies are getting shorter over 
time? like from 1940 to 2020.

We have used netflix_data set from kaggle and performed analysis on it. We have visualized the data at the end using scatter plot
